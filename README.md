# QualityReview

A Gradle tool for Java learners to improve the code quality.

## Usage

Using `gradle qualityReview` all Java files in the `src` directory are checked using [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net), [PMD](https://pmd.github.io) and [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net) for code smells and potential bugs.
The checks are a subset of the tools' rules to make them more appropriate for educational purposes.

All reports are collected in the reports directory.
